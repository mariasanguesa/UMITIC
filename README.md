# Unsupervised Hierarchical Tissue Characterization in Multiplex and Hyperplexed Imaging
Summary: Multiplexed imaging technologies have transformed the study of tissue composition by enabling the simultaneous visualization of numerous biomarkers in a single specimen. The emergence of hyperplex imaging (>20 markers) is gaining particular relevance, offering deep insight into cellular composition and organization. However, this level of detail introduces significant analytical challenges, especially in the context of digital pathology, where the complexity of tissue organization presents a major analytical challenge. Here, we present a fully unsupervised framework for the characterization of multiplex immunofluorescence images at single-cell resolution. Our approach begins with the integration of two advanced deep learning-based cell segmentation strategies, followed by a post-processing step to refine segmentation accuracy. We then employ a contrastive learning scheme to extract low-dimensional, label-free representations of individual cells. These embeddings are enriched with morphological descriptors and spatial features using a custom-designed Graph Neural Network that explicitly models cellular interactions. Building on these representations, we implement a hierarchical analysis pipeline: (i) classification of cell types based on phenotypic features, and (ii) neighborhood-level characterization incorporating spatial context. This multi-level strategy enables a detailed and interpretable understanding of both cellular identities and tissue architecture. By linking cellular phenotypes to their spatial environments, our framework provides a powerful tool for unbiased tissue profiling in digital. The pipeline is fully annotation-free and demonstrates scalability across datasets containing between 7 and 43 markers. To our knowledge, this is the first fully unsupervised method capable of analyzing hyperplex immunofluorescence data at this scale.
